# ICEE Github Repository

This repository contains all of the MATLAB scripts for running the CANLAB's ICEE Study.

## Running the Experiment

To run the experiment, you will need to follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the experiment folder, e.g. `/Desktop/EXPERIMENTS/ICEE`  
2. Type `icee` into the command window  
3. Debug Mode:  
    + `y` enter debug mode, smaller screen for debugging purposes and the experiment runs twice as fast  
    + `n` do not enter debug mode, run full screen  
4. Subject:  
    + subject's ID  
    
## Experiment Functionality

+ When at an instructions screen, you hit `spacebar` to advance and `escape` to quit
+ When at a trigger screen, you can hit `t` to advance and `escape` to quit
+ The experiment (as it is written on this website) records the `1!` `2@` `3#` and `4$` keyboard keys during encoding and the `1!` and `2@` keys during encoding. The lines of code specifying these keys may need to be changed to correspond to the button boxes at the scanner
